## 5. Integration Points

### 5.1 Suite Integration

**API Contract**:

```python
# Suite registration
POST /api/v1/suites/register
{
  "suite_id": "fedsuite",
  "base_url": "http://fedsuite:8081",
  "capabilities": ["gtas", "cars", "sf133"],
  "health_endpoint": "/health"
}

# Suite execution
POST /api/v1/suites/{suite_id}/execute
{
  "workflow_id": "gtas-monthly",
  "input_data": {...},
  "tenant_id": "agency-dod-001"
}
```

**Event Bus** (Redis Streams):

```python
# Publish event
XADD cortx:events *
  event_type "workflow_completed"
  tenant_id "agency-dod-001"
  workflow_id "gtas-monthly"
  status "success"

# Subscribe
XREAD COUNT 10 STREAMS cortx:events 0
```

### 5.2 External Systems

### 5.3 Supporting CORTX Assets

- **cortx-designer**: Low-code authoring interface that publishes RulePacks and WorkflowPacks into the platform registry via Gateway and Ledger services, ensuring provenance for every change.
- **cortx-packs**: Source of truth for versioned packs that platform Validation and Workflow services consume; SemVer directories align with Schema Service governance.
- **cortx-sdks**: Python and TypeScript client libraries providing typed access to all platform services; downstream suites and third parties integrate through these SDKs to avoid contract drift.
- **cortx-e2e**: Cross-service contract and scenario testing harness validating suite-to-platform integrations before deployment.
- **docs / site**: MkDocs-based documentation portal that syncs OpenAPI specifications from each service repository via `scripts/sync_openapi.sh`, keeping platform and suite documentation current for auditors and implementers.

### 5.4 AI Model APIs

**Current**:

- Google Vertex AI: Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash
- LangChain: Orchestration framework

**Planned**:

- Anthropic Claude API
- OpenAI GPT-4 API
- AWS Bedrock
- Hugging Face Inference API (on-prem)
