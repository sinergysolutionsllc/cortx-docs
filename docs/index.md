# CORTX Docs Portal

Welcome to the central documentation portal for the CORTX platform by Sinergy. This site aggregates user guides and OpenAPI contracts for core platform services.

- Use the Services section to learn about each service and find links to its API contracts.
- Use the APIs section to view the OpenAPI for each service rendered via Redoc.

If you’re contributing to a service, update the service’s OpenAPI spec in its own repository. The docs portal fetches the latest specs during CI via `scripts/sync_openapi.sh`.
