# NIST 800-53 Access Control Requirements

## AC-1 Access Control Policy and Procedures

Organizations must develop, document, and disseminate access control policies that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.

## AC-2 Account Management

The organization must:

- Identify and select authorized system users
- Establish conditions for group and role membership
- Specify authorized users, group membership, and privileges
- Require approvals for requests to create accounts
- Monitor the use of system accounts
- Review accounts for compliance at least annually

## AC-3 Access Enforcement

The information system must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

## AC-4 Information Flow Enforcement

Control mechanisms must enforce approved authorizations for information flows within the system and between interconnected systems based on applicable policy.

## Key Principles

1. **Least Privilege**: Users should only have the minimum access rights needed to perform their duties
2. **Separation of Duties**: Critical functions should be divided among different individuals to prevent fraud
3. **Need-to-Know**: Access should be granted only when there is a legitimate business need
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls should be implemented

## Compliance Verification

Federal agencies must demonstrate compliance through:

- Annual security assessments
- Continuous monitoring
- Independent audits
- Documentation of security controls
