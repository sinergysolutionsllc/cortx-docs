# Phase 4 Summary - Packs & Designer Integration

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Phase 4 focused on organizing and validating the CORTX Packs repository and ensuring the Designer can compile and publish packs to the platform registry.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. ✅ cortx-packs Repository Organization

**Repository:** https://github.com/sinergysolutionsllc/cortx-packs

**Structure Verified:**
```
cortx-packs/
├── rulepacks/              # Validation rules (federal, corporate, healthcare, state_local)
├── workflowpacks/          # Process definitions (cross_suite, suite_specific)
├── schemas/                # JSONSchema definitions
├── tests/
│   ├── data/              # ✅ Added: Golden datasets
│   └── validation/        # ✅ Added: Rule-level tests
├── signing/               # ✅ Added: Sigstore/cosign materials
├── docs/                  # Pack documentation
└── .github/workflows/     # CI/CD
```

**Actions Taken:**
- Verified existing rulepacks/ and workflowpacks/ organization
- Created tests/data/ for golden test datasets
- Created tests/validation/ for rule-level test cases
- Created signing/ for cryptographic signing materials

### 2. ✅ Pack Validation CI Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/packs.yml` in cortx-packs

**Workflow Features:**
- Calls `reusable-pack-validate.yml` from cortx-ci
- Validates JSON Schema compliance
- Enforces SemVer tagging
- Verifies pack signatures (when present)
- Runs rule tests against golden datasets
- Generates pack documentation

**Pull Request:** https://github.com/sinergysolutionsllc/cortx-packs/pull/1

**Status:** Pending review (protected branch)

### 3. ✅ PACKS_README.md Documentation

**File:** `cortx-packs/PACKS_README.md`

**Contents:**
- **Semantic Versioning Policy**
  - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
  - Version increment rules
  - Version metadata requirements

- **Pack Signing Policy**
  - Sigstore (cosign) implementation
  - Environment-specific key management
  - Signature storage and verification

- **Pack Publishing Workflow**
  - Development → Validation → Versioning → Publishing
  - Automated CI/CD pipeline
  - Registry integration

- **Pack Testing Guidelines**
  - Golden dataset structure
  - Validation test examples
  - Best practices

- **Security & Compliance**
  - Immutability requirements
  - Access control policies
  - Audit logging

- **Pack Registry Integration**
  - API endpoints
  - Operations (list, get, publish, download)
  - Authentication requirements

### 4. ✅ cortx-designer Verification

**Repository:** https://github.com/sinergysolutionsllc/cortx-designer

**Structure Verified:**
```
cortx-designer/
├── backend/               # FastAPI compiler service
├── frontend/              # Next.js visual builder
├── compiler/              # Pack compilation logic
├── adapters/              # Integration adapters
├── packages/              # Shared UI components
└── .github/workflows/     # Existing CI (Python + Node)
```

**Existing CI Workflow:**
- Python backend: lint, test
- Node frontend: lint, build, test
- Matrix strategy for multi-language support

**Status:** Operational, no changes needed

## Implementation Notes

### Pack Registry Integration

The pack registry is implemented as part of the `cortx-validation` service:

**Endpoint:** `https://api.cortx.platform/packs`

**Operations:**
- `GET /packs` - List available packs
- `GET /packs/{suite}/{pack}/{version}` - Get specific pack
- `POST /packs` - Publish pack (authenticated)
- `GET /packs/{suite}/{pack}/{version}/download` - Download pack

**Implementation:** Pending full cortx-validation API deployment

### Pack Compilation Test

Sample pack compilation from Designer to registry:

```python
# In cortx-designer/compiler
def compile_and_publish_pack(pack_definition):
    # 1. Compile pack from visual definition
    compiled_pack = compiler.compile(pack_definition)

    # 2. Validate against schema
    validate_schema(compiled_pack, "schemas/rulepack.schema.json")

    # 3. Sign pack (prod only)
    if env == "prod":
        signature = sign_pack(compiled_pack)

    # 4. Publish to registry
    response = publish_to_registry(
        pack=compiled_pack,
        signature=signature
    )

    return response
```

**Status:** Implementation-dependent on cortx-validation registry API

## Next Steps (Phase 5)

According to REPO_FIX_PROMPT_08OCT.MD:

**Phase 5: Suites & SDKs**

Tasks:
1. Organize suites in cortx-suites or individual repos
2. Implement shared UI libraries
3. Create multi-suite layout
4. Generate SDK clients from OpenAPI specs
5. Publish SDKs to PyPI/npm
