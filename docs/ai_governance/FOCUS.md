### Medium Priority (Schedule)
- Performance improvements with measurable impact
- Technical debt reducing development velocity
- Features with committed customer contracts
- Scalability improvements for known limits

### Low Priority (Backlog)
- Nice-to-have features without customer demand
- Speculative optimizations
- Aesthetic improvements without UX impact
- Experimental technologies without clear ROI

### Defer (Not Now)
- International expansion features
- Mobile applications
- On-premises deployment (non-enterprise)
