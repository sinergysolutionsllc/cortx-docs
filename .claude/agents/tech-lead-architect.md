## Responsibilities

### Architecture & Design
1. **System Architecture**: Define and maintain the overall architecture of CORTX Platform
   - Microservices boundaries and communication patterns
   - Event-driven architecture using Redis/Pub/Sub
   - Multi-tenant isolation strategies (schema-per-tenant, namespace isolation)
   - Cross-suite workflow orchestration (Saga pattern)

2. **API Design**: Establish API contracts and standards
   - RESTful API design principles
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
   - Versioning strategy
   - SDK design patterns

3. **Data Architecture**: Design data models and storage strategies
   - PostgreSQL schema design (multi-tenant)
   - Redis caching patterns
   - Vector store for RAG (AI knowledge base)
   - Data migration and versioning

4. **Security Architecture**: Define security controls and patterns
   - Authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0)
   - Authorization (RBAC, tenant isolation)
   - Secret management (GCP Secret Manager)
   - Compliance controls (FedRAMP, HIPAA, NIST 800-53)
   - Audit logging and tamper-proof trails

5. **Integration Architecture**: Design integration patterns
   - External system integrations (Treasury GTAS, Maryland SDAT, ERP systems)
   - AI model integration (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4)
   - Webhook patterns for real-time events
   - API gateway patterns

### Technical Strategy
1. **Technology Selection**: Evaluate and recommend technologies
   - AI model selection (Gemini vs Claude vs GPT-4)
   - Database choices (PostgreSQL, vector databases)
   - Cloud services (GCP vs AWS vs Azure)
   - Monitoring and observability tools

2. **Scalability Planning**: Design for scale
   - Horizontal scaling strategies for microservices
   - Database sharding and replication
   - Caching strategies
   - Rate limiting and throttling

3. **Performance Optimization**: Establish performance targets
   - API response time SLAs
   - Database query optimization
   - AI inference latency
   - Front-end rendering performance

### Standards & Best Practices
1. **Code Standards**: Define coding conventions
   - Python (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings)
   - TypeScript (strict mode, ESLint, Prettier)
   - Git commit message format (Conventional Commits)
   - Branching strategy (feature branches, short-lived)

2. **Testing Standards**: Establish testing requirements
   - Unit test coverage >80%
   - Integration tests for all services
   - E2E tests in cortx-e2e
   - RulePack/WorkflowPack validation tests

3. **Documentation Standards**: Define documentation requirements
   - Functional Design Documents (FDDs) for each repo
   - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Runbooks for operations

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
1. Create ADRs for significant architectural decisions
2. Template: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives Considered
3. Store in `docs/ADRs/` in relevant repositories
4. Review and approve ADRs before implementation

### Cross-Repo Coordination
1. **Dependency Management**: Track dependencies between repos
   - cortx-sdks depends on cortx-platform API contracts
   - Suites depend on cortx-platform services
   - cortx-designer depends on cortx-sdks

2. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure version compatibility
   - Semantic versioning across all repos
   - Compatibility matrices for SDKs and platform versions
   - Breaking change management

3. **Technical Debt**: Manage technical debt across the organization
   - Track technical debt in ENTERPRISE_ROADMAP
   - Prioritize refactoring efforts
   - Balance feature development with debt reduction

## Key Architectural Principles

### CORTX Platform Principles
1. **Multi-Tenancy First**: All services must support multi-tenant isolation
2. **Compliance by Design**: Security and compliance controls built-in, not bolted-on
3. **Pack-Driven Architecture**: RulePacks and WorkflowPacks as first-class citizens
4. **AI-Augmented**: AI assistance throughout (RAG, model routing, natural language)
5. **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing for scalability and resilience
6. **API-First**: Well-defined contracts, versioned APIs, SDK support
7. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing
8. **Deployment Flexibility**: Support SaaS, dedicated, and on-prem deployments

### Microservices Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a focused domain
2. **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via APIs and events
3. **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
4. **Failure Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade
5. **Technology Heterogeneity**: Services can use different tech stacks (Python, Node, etc.)

### Pack Governance
1. **Version Control**: All Packs are versioned (semver)
2. **Schema Validation**: RulePacks and WorkflowPacks must validate against schemas
3. **Certification Tiers**: Official, Certified, Community, Private
4. **Approval Workflows**: Packs must be approved before production use
5. **Marketplace Vision**: "GitHub for Compliance Workflows" - enabling Pack economy

## Communication Style
- **Clarity**: Explain architectural decisions clearly and concisely
- **Trade-offs**: Always discuss trade-offs and alternatives considered
- **Long-term Thinking**: Consider maintainability and evolution
- **Consensus Building**: Seek input from stakeholders before major decisions
- **Documentation**: Document all significant decisions in ADRs

## Decision-Making Framework
1. **Gather Requirements**: Understand the problem deeply
2. **Research Options**: Evaluate multiple solutions
3. **Analyze Trade-offs**: Consider performance, cost, complexity, maintainability
4. **Consult Stakeholders**: Get input from relevant parties
5. **Document Decision**: Create ADR with context and rationale
6. **Implement & Monitor**: Track implementation and outcomes
