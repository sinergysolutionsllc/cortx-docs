# Daily Log - October 7, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

Today was a highly productive session focused on the CORTX platform refactoring and service implementation. The majority of the core platform services are now implemented, with significant progress on the RAG (ThinkTank), OCR, and Ledger services. The platform's backend infrastructure is largely complete, and the remaining work is centered on implementing the final few services and integrating the frontend applications into the new monorepo structure.

- **Overall Progress**: ~60% of the refactoring is complete.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - The **OCR service** was fully implemented with a multi-tier AI-enhanced pipeline.
  - The **Ledger service** was completed, providing an immutable, hash-chained audit log.
  - The **RAG service (ThinkTank)** is fully functional, with both frontend and backend components ported and operational.
  - Demo content has been seeded into the RAG service.
  - Gateway routes for all new platform services have been configured.
- **Blockers**: The main blocker is a Docker permission issue causing backend services to crash, which has been identified and a fix is specified.

## 2. Platform Status

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Overall Status**: Partially Working

| Component           | Status                  | Notes                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Apps**   | **3 of 4 Starting**     | `OffermAit` and `CORTX Suites` have issues. `CORTX Designer` is fixed but has a startup script issue. |
| **Backend Services**| **5 of 9 Implemented**  | `Gateway`, `Identity`, `Validation`, `Workflow`, `Compliance` are implemented but crashing on startup.    |
|                     | **4 of 9 Implemented**  | `RAG`, `OCR`, `Ledger` are newly implemented. `AI Broker` is spec-only.                                 |
| **Infrastructure**  | ✅ **Working**          | PostgreSQL (with pgvector) and Redis are running correctly. Docker is configured.                     |

## 3. Completed Work

### a. OCR Service Implementation (100% Complete)

The **OCR Service (port 8137)** was fully implemented and is now operational.

- **Multi-Tier Pipeline**:
  - **Tier 1 (Tesseract)**: For fast, free OCR on modern documents.
  - **Tier 2 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**: AI-enhanced OCR for complex or handwritten text.
  - **Tier 3 (Human Review)**: For critical documents requiring perfect accuracy.
- **Smart Features**: Includes SHA-256 hash-caching to prevent reprocessing, automatic tier escalation based on confidence scores, and document preprocessing.
- **Deployment**: The service has a multi-stage Dockerfile, comprehensive documentation, and is running and healthy.

### b. Ledger Service Implementation (100% Complete)

The **Ledger Service (port 8136)** was implemented to provide an immutable, tamper-evident audit trail.

- **Technology**: Uses a PostgreSQL-backed hash-chain, where each event is linked to the previous one via a SHA-256 hash.
- **Features**: Append-only log, multi-tenant event isolation, chain integrity verification, and CSV export for auditors.
- **Status**: The service is running, and the hash-chain functionality has been tested and verified.

### c. RAG Service (ThinkTank) Implementation (95% Complete)

The **ThinkTank AI Assistant** was successfully ported and is nearly ready for demo.

- **Frontend**: UI components (`ThinkTankAssistant`, `ThinkTankPage`) are built and packaged in `@sinergysolutions/cortx-ui`. The UI is integrated into FedSuite and is context-aware (detects suite/module from the URL).
- **Backend**: The RAG service is running in Docker on port 8138, connected to the database, and the full query pipeline is functional.
- **Demo Content**: The RAG service was seeded with 6 demo documents to showcase its hierarchical retrieval capabilities.

### d. Gateway and Documentation Updates

- **Gateway**: Proxy routes were configured in the Gateway service to direct traffic to the new `RAG`, `OCR`, and `Ledger` services.
- **Documentation**: Several documents were created or updated to reflect the day's progress, including service READMEs, quick start guides, and implementation summaries.

## 4. In Progress & Remaining Work

### a. Critical Issues to Resolve

1. **Dockerfile Permission Bug (BLOCKING)**: All 5 of the original backend services are crashing due to a user permission issue in the Dockerfiles.
    - **Fix**: Remove the `--user` flag from `pip install` commands within the Dockerfiles to install packages globally. This is the highest priority task.

### b. Remaining Services to Implement

1. **AI Broker Service (port 8085)**: This is the last core service to be implemented. It is critical for the CORTX Designer and for moving the RAG service off mock responses.

### c. Frontend Integration

- The `OffermAit` and `CORTX Suites` frontends need to be moved into the monorepo.
- The `start-all.sh` script needs to be adjusted to not kill all frontend processes if one fails.

## 5. Key Decisions & Technical Debt

### a. Key Architectural Decisions

- **Ledger Implementation**: A PostgreSQL-based hash-chain was chosen over a more complex blockchain solution as it meets current audit requirements with lower operational overhead.
- **Hierarchical RAG**: The RAG service was designed with a 4-level hierarchy (Platform → Suite → Module → Entity) to provide context-specific answers.
- **Centralized Services**: The decision to centralize `OCR`, `Ledger`, and `RAG` as platform services was validated and implemented, reducing code duplication.

### b. Technical Debt Identified

1. **Inconsistent Healthchecks**: Some services report as "unhealthy" in Docker despite being functional. The healthcheck endpoints need to be standardized.
2. **Missing Tests**: The newly implemented services lack unit and integration tests.
3. **Configuration Management**: Environment variables need to be centralized and managed more effectively.

---

## 6. Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix the Dockerfile permission bug** for the 5 crashing backend services.
2. **Implement the AI Broker service**.
3. **Integrate the remaining frontend applications** into the monorepo.
4. **Write tests** for the new `OCR`, `Ledger`, and `RAG` services.
5. **Consolidate and organize all documentation**.
