## 🚀 Verification Steps

### 1. Codecov Token ✅ COMPLETE

You've added the CODECOV_TOKEN to GitHub secrets.

### 2. Test the CI/CD Pipeline

Let's verify everything works by running a test:

```bash
# Option 1: Test Workflow service (we just fixed it)
gh workflow run test-workflow.yml

# Option 2: Test all services
gh workflow run test-all-services.yml

# Watch the run
gh run watch
```

### 3. Expected Results

**Within 5-10 minutes you should see:**

1. **GitHub Actions:**
   - ✅ All workflows running in parallel
   - ✅ Tests executing for each service
   - ✅ Coverage being collected
   - ✅ Codecov upload succeeding

2. **Codecov Dashboard** (<https://codecov.io>):
   - Coverage percentages for each service
   - Service-level flags showing coverage breakdown
   - Coverage trends graph
   - File-by-file coverage details

3. **Quality Gates:**
   - ✅ All services passing 80% threshold
   - ✅ Status checks green
   - ✅ Ready for production
